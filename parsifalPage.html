						<h1>Parsifal story</h1>
					
						<p>In a forest near the home of the Grail and its Knights, Gurnemanz, eldest Knight of the Grail,
						wakes his young squires and leads them in prayer. He sees Amfortas, King of the Grail Knights, and his entourage approaching.
						Amfortas has been injured by his own Holy Spear, and the wound will not heal.</p>
						
						<p>Gurnemanz asks the lead Knight for news of the King's health.
						The Knight says the King has suffered during the night and is going early to bathe in the holy lake.
						The squires ask Gurnemanz to explain how the King's injury can be healed, but he evades their question and a wild woman – Kundry – bursts in.
						She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam, brought from Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.</p>
						
						<p>Amfortas arrives, borne on a stretcher by Knights of the Grail.
						He calls out for Gawain, whose attempt at relieving the King's pain had failed.
						He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy.
						Raising himself somewhat, the King says going off without leave ("Ohn' Urlaub?") is the sort of impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall.
						He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath.</p>
						
						<p>The procession leaves. The squires eye Kundry with mistrust and question her.
						After a brief retort, she falls silent. Gurnemanz tells them Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights 
						but that she comes and goes unpredictably. When he asks directly why she does not stay to help, she answers, "I never help!
						("Ich helfe nie!"). The squires think she is a witch and sneer that if she does so much, why will she not find the Holy Spear for them?
						Gurnemanz reveals that this deed is destined for someone else.
						He says Amfortas was given guardianship of the Spear, but lost it as he was seduced by an irresistibly attractive woman in Klingsor's domain.
						Klingsor grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas. The wound causes Amfortas both suffering and shame, and will never heal on its own.</p>

					<p>Check out more at their site redbuble.com! <br> myth coming down to an error in the translation of the ancient stories.
